# Cancer-Detection-with-CNNs
Detection of Cancer in pathology images of breast tissues using deep learning

## Motivation:
The goal of this project is to assist pathologists in detecting cancer cells in gigapixel pathology images. Visual inspection of the pathology slides is error prone and tedious for the already rare expertise. Hence, we hope to provide assistance in these detections for the doctors.
